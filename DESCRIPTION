Description: A Bayesian hybrid approach for inferring a Directed Acyclic Graph
    (DAG) for continuous, discrete, and mixed data. To speed up the inference of
    the DAG the algorithm uses a constraint-based method (e.g., the PC algorithm)
    to reduce the search space; a score-based search method is then used to
    infer the probability of direction for the edges in the network.
