\usage{
simdata(b0 = 0, N = 500, s = 1, ss = 1, graph = "gn4", p = 0.1,
  ssc = 0.2, nConfounding = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{b0}{The mean of the variable if it does not have any parents. If the
variable has one or more parents it is the slope in the linear model that is
the mean of the normally distributed variables.}

\item{N}{The number of observations to simulate.}

\item{s}{The standard deviation of the normal distribution.}

\item{ss}{The coefficient of the parent nodes (if there are any) in the
linear model that is the mean of the normally distributed variables. This
coefficient is referred to as the signal strength.}

\item{graph}{A character string of the graph for which data will be
simulated. The graphs that can be chosen are m1_ge, m1_gv, m1_cp, m1_cc,
m1_iv, m2_ge, m2_gv, m2_cp, m2_cc, m2_iv, mp_ge, mp_gv, gn4, gn5, gn8, gn11,
layer, and star.

The following figures show the graph for each of the topologies listed above.
The nodes with a circle around the name of the node are normally distributed
and the nodes with a diamond around the name are distributed multinomial. The
nodes labeled with a C represent confounding variables and the nodes labeled
with a U represent genetic variants.

\item{p}{The frequency of the reference allele.}

\item{ssc}{The signal strength of the confounding variables.}

\item{nConfounding}{The number of confounding variables to simulate.}
}
\value{
A matrix with the variables across the columns and the observations
down the rows.
}
\description{
A function for simulating data under various topologies for continuous and
mixed data.
