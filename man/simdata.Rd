\usage{
simdata(b0 = 0, N = 500, s = 1, ss = 1, graph = "gn4", p = 0.1,
  ssc = 0.2, nConfounding = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{b0}{The mean of the variable if it does not have any parents. If the
variable has one or more parents it is the slope in the linear model that is
the mean of the normally distributed variables.}

\item{N}{The number of observations to simulate.}

\item{s}{The standard deviation of the normal distribution.}

\item{ss}{The coefficient of the parent nodes (if there are any) in the
linear model that is the mean of the normally distributed variables. This
coefficient is referred to as the signal strength.}

\item{graph}{A character string of the graph for which data will be
simulated. The graphs that can be chosen are m1_ge, m1_gv, m1_cp, m1_cc,
m1_iv, m2_ge, m2_gv, m2_cp, m2_cc, m2_iv, mp_ge, mp_gv, gn4, gn5, gn8, gn11,
layer, and star.

The following figures show the graph for each of the topologies listed above.
The nodes with a circle around the name are normally distributed and the
nodes with a diamond around the name are distributed multinomial. The nodes
labeled with a C represent confounding variables. The Principle of Mendelian
Randomization (PMR) can be used on graphs with discrete random variables,
nodes labelled with a U. This introduces the constraint that the continuous
random variables cannot be parents of discrete random variables and edges
between these types of variables only have two states: absent and directed
with the discrete random variable as the parent.

m1_ge

Topology M1 with three continuous random variables. In this case M1 has two
other Markov equivalent graphs.

variables. When using the PMR this graph does not have any other Markov
equivalent graphs.
